# AdditionProblem
Finding many solutions to abc+abc+abc=ccc. where a, b, and c are positive integers.

This started out by trying to find digits a, b, and c that satisfied the mathmatical equation 
```
 abc
+abc
+abc
----
 ccc 
```

Then Brian Jones took it to another level and tried to find all integers. 

I tried several attempts at this in the code ranging from a full n^3 arrangement to finally came up with an n^1 solultion that just checks the answers.
